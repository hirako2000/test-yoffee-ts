# Tiny setup for yoffee with TypeScript

This uses parcel.

It simply displays a name and age held as a Yoffee state variable passed to `html` yoffee elements.
With a button triggering an update of the age state property.

Other than making sure the yoffee dependency has the type declaration, everything should nicely work out of the box.
